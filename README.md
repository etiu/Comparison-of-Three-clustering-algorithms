## Tech Stack

**User:** Pandas, SciKit Learn, RDKit



## Lessons Learned

In this project I was able to execute the exact same clustering techniques performed using KNIME in the youtube tutorial. This project allowed me to exercise my knowledge in coding through using ML algorithms in Scikit Learn.
