# Three Clustering Algorithms Comparison (Hierarchical Clustering, K Means, and DBSCAN)
Some keywords in this project:
- Tanimoto similarity distances,
- Morgan Fingerprint,
- Hierarchical agglomerative,
- K Means,
- DBSCAN
The dataset comprising of different molecules were obtained from the ChEMBL database.

## Tech Stack

**User:** Pandas, SciKit Learn, RDKit



## Lessons Learned

In this project I was able to execute the exact same clustering techniques performed using KNIME in the youtube tutorial. This project allowed me to exercise my knowledge in coding through using ML algorithms in Scikit Learn.
